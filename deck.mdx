# The What

- Typescript is just javascript + (optional) typesystem which compiles to regular javascript

---

# Why would you use typescript

- vscode autocompletion (function params, react props)
- way better refactoring
- maybe even prevents bugs ðŸ¤ª

---

# What makes TS special

- The type system is gradual (types are optional)
- Your code will always "compile"
- Treat the compiler errors as **"just"** suggestions !!!

---

# What makes TS special

- Type system is structural (as opposed to nominal)
- You describe the **shape** of your data
- The types can be "separate" from the code

---

# Fun fact

TS is turing complete [https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/issues/14833)

---

# Demo time !!!

---

# How

- Opt in for a single file: `// @ts-check`
- Start a new react project: `npx create-react-app my-app --typescript`
- Add to an existing project using babel:
  - `npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-typescript`
  - create a `tsconfig.json` and add a `noEmit: true` option

# Thank you !!!
